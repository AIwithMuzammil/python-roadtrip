# Python-Roadtrip: A Complete Python Journey

Welcome to this repository, where you'll be taking a complete journey through the world of Python! This repository will serve as a guide, with each tutorial building upon the knowledge and skills learned in previous tutorials.

The tutorials in this repository will be accompanied by videos on my YouTube channel, [AI with Muzammil](https://www.youtube.com/@AIwithMuzammil). This will provide a hands-on, step-by-step approach to learning Python, so you can see the concepts in action and ask questions along the way.

## Learning Codebase
1. Stop 01: [Set-up Python](/GettingStarted/)
2. Stop 02: [What are data variables and how to use them?](/DataVariables/)
3. Stop 03: [Python Console Input and Logical Operators](/Inputs-LogicalOperators/)
4. Stop 04: [Conditional Statements and Loops in Python](/ConditionalStatements-and-Loops/)
5. Stop 05: [Functions in Python](/Functions/)

## Summary
Here's what you can expect from this journey:

1. **Getting Started with Python**: In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of the Python from installation to setting up the first program.

2. **Dealing with Data**: In this tutorial, we'll learn about Python's built-in data types, data structures, including lists, dictionaries, and tuples, and we'll explore how to manipulate and process data with Python.

3. **Python Console Input and Logical Operators**: In this tutorial, we'll learn how to take inputs from python console/terminal, and we'll also discuss different logical operators.


4. **Loops and Control Structure**: In this tutorial, we'll take a closer look at loops and control structures in Python, learning how to define and use them in different situations.

5. **Working with Functions and Modules**: In this tutorial, we'll dive deeper into the world of Python, exploring functions and modules, and learning how to write reusable code.

And much more!
